1. Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed.
Automating tests through GitHub Actions ensures that tests run consistently on every push, helping catch bugs early in the development process. This setup integrates seamlessly with version control and prevents broken code from being merged, leading to more stable and reliable software over time.

3. Navigation mode evaluates a webpage by fully loading it from the beginning, allowing Lighthouse to measure performance metrics like load time, layout shifts, and resource usage during the initial page load. In contrast, snapshot mode captures the page in its current state without reloading, focusing mainly on static aspects such as accessibility and visual issues. While navigation mode assesses dynamic behavior during loading, snapshot mode is best for auditing the pageâ€™s present layout and content.

4. Based on the Lighthouse results, three improvements we could make to the CSE 110 Shop site are: (1) Optimize image sizes by compressing or serving images in next-gen formats like WebP to improve load speed and performance scores; (2) Add meaningful alt text to all images to enhance accessibility for screen readers; and (3) Ensure all elements use sufficient color contrast to improve readability and meet accessibility standards.
